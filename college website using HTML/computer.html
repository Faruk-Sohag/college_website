    <h3><font color="maroon">Computer Science</font></h3>
    <p>Computer Science is the study of systems that can be used to solve complex data problems through computation and critical thinking. It encompasses the study of computers and algorithmic processes, including their principles, hardware and software designs and their applications. Being one of the most pursued degree courses after 12th Science, the career opportunities in this field are vast.
        The CSE course covers computational-related subjects such as programming languages, algorithm analysis, software, 
        device hardware & programme design. Computer science was previously considered as part of the departments of mathematics 
        or engineering, but now it has become a different field of engineering.</p>
